Today's Plan:
-------------
1)Ip adressing and subnetting
2)VPC,Subnets and Routing table creation
3)Deploying Linux server in VPC.

1)Ip adressing and subnetting:
------------------------------
Ipv4 -> 32 bit
Ipv6 -> 128 bit

Ip address range ->0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
IP address classes:- https://www.guru99.com/ip-address-classes.html
127.x.x.x -> Loop back address

RFC-1918:
https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/get-connected/wired-networks/use-private-rfc1918-address-space-ucl-internal-network

10.0.0.0 (255.0.0.0 =10.0.0.0/8) (10 is constant)
10.0.0.0 (255.255.0.0 =10.0.0.0/16) (10.0 is constant)
10.0.0.0 (255.255.255.0 =10.0.0.0/24) (10.0.0 is constant)

VPC:
----
uses  1) Resolves security issues
      2) Resolves IP adresses conflicts
